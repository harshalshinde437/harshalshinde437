### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Data Engineer with 2.5+ years of hands-on experience** building **scalable ETL/ELT pipelines, analytics platforms, and data-driven applications** across cloud and hybrid environments. My core focus is on **data reliability, performance optimization, and analytics-ready data modeling** using modern data engineering tools.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **data pipelines, analytics, and applied machine learning**, designing systems that transform raw, noisy data into **actionable insights**. I also have prior exposure to distributed systems and containerized deployments, which helps me build production-ready data platforms.
